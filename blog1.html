                    <p>Explore what it means to be a strong woman in millennial times as Kamila of Cammy, a modern day Katherine Hepburn of sorts, dives into the deep waters of the feminine conscious — and shares some classy and powerful looks for fall.

                        “For thousands of years, women were regarded as the weaker sex. Haunted by the image of a strong woman, our society labels it as something bad and different — even unnecessary. Since men were the ones that fulfilled the professional field, returning home from hunting lions and such, they were held in higher regard (but things are a little different now).

                        Kayah in an interview said, ‘I have many of the characteristics attributed to men: courage, consistency, joviality, prowess. Although I must admit that I can not stand this division, I do not understand why it is men who are credited with consistency and courage.’

                        And indeed, it is difficult to understand the existing dichotomy of our society, in which something is male or female, where as such qualities as courage, strength, consistency and independence (for each field) are assigned only to men. A woman is expected to be primarily submissive, grateful, weak and passive, but what happens in a situation when certain stereotypes are broken? It turns out that with the expansion of freedom for women, the strength and potential that once lay dormant can be enormous.

                        I happen to hear from many women, the famous term ‘men fear me,’ and the first thought that occurs to me in such a situation is that there's something really wrong. If your self-confidence, courage and consistency strikes fear in other people, the root must be hidden somewhere. It’s important to ask, ‘Does my company make people feel good? Am I sharp or unpleasant? If so, it has nothing to do with strength but is rather a sign of a lack of sensitivity.’ How does strength look in each one of us? It’s certainly very different and one recipe does not solve the same problem, so it’s important to independently analyze each of our own situations
